This is a WIP for a HAB mapper app to be used internally or externally on our website

The current plan is to have two tabs:

- Advisory Map tab
	- This tab will show current and past advisories, with a basic map and table.
	  May be the only tab used/visible on the website.

- Cyanotoxin Explorer tab
	- This tab will download LIMS (WQX instead?) cyanotoxin data for all of Arkansas.
	  Will show a map, plot, and table. Users can click between sites and filter for
	  different toxins to plot. May not be used on website for now (code will remain
	  in the app but commented out for now).
